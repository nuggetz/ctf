# GET aHEAD Walkthrough


This challenge provides subtle hints in both its **title** and **description**:

The emphasis on “GET aHEAD” suggests that the solution may involve manipulating HTTP request methods, specifically switching from the commonly used GET method to HEAD.


### Step 1: Visiting the Site

Clicking on the challenge link brings us to a simple webpage with two buttons:

![[GETaHEAD - site.png]]


At first glance, there doesn’t seem to be anything unusual about the functionality.


### Step 2: Inspecting the Site

Following standard initial steps, I open the **browser inspector** to examine the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

Unfortunately, this doesn’t reveal any clues or hidden elements.


### Step 3: Reviewing the Hints

The challenge provides two hints:

This suggests that the visible options (blue and red) aren’t the only possibilities.

This confirms that analyzing or modifying HTTP requests is key to solving the challenge.


**Step 4: Using Burp Suite**

To proceed, we set up **Burp Suite** to intercept the HTTP traffic between the browser and the server.
_(Refer to the IntroToBurp Walkthrough for detailed setup instructions.)_

Upon interacting with the website, we observe the following in Burp Suite:
- The buttons trigger simple GET requests to the server to change the background color.
- There are no additional clues in the responses or headers.


**Step 5: Playing with the HTTP Request**

Given the challenge title’s hint about HEAD, I decide to test different HTTP methods.

To do this:
1. **Send the** GET **request to the Repeater module** in Burp Suite.
_(This allows us to modify and resend requests easily.)_

2. **Modify the HTTP method**:
Change GET to HEAD in the request.
- The HEAD method is similar to GET, but it only requests the headers of a resource without retrieving the full body.
- It’s often used to check metadata or perform quick server queries.

3. **Send the modified request**:
Upon doing so, the server’s response includes the **flag**!

> [!NOTE]
> **Why This Works**
> 
> The challenge leverages the lesser-known HEAD HTTP method to hide the flag in plain sight. Most users stick to GET requests when browsing, so the server has a separate logic path for HEAD requests that isn’t immediately visible.

This demonstrates the importance of understanding and testing **different HTTP methods** during web application testing, as some methods might expose sensitive data or unintended functionality.


### Conclusion

This challenge highlights a simple but crucial lesson for web security:

• **HTTP Methods Matter:** Always test for alternate methods (HEAD, POST, PUT, etc.) during recon or pentesting.
• **Burp Suite is Your Friend:** Tools like Burp Suite make it easy to modify requests and experiment with different approaches.


See you in the next challenge!
