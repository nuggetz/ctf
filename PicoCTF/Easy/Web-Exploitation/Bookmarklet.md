### Steps to Solve

> [!NOTE]
> **Understand the Bookmarklet**
> 
> A bookmarklet is a snippet of JavaScript code that can be saved as a browser bookmark. When clicked, the script runs directly in the context of the current webpage.
> 
> In this case, the provided code decrypts an encrypted string (encryptedFlag) using a repeating key (picoctf) and then displays the result in a browser alert.

- **Create the Bookmarklet**
I copied the entire code snippet starting with javascript:(function() { into my clipboard.
Then, I created a new bookmark in my browser and pasted the code into the URL field.
