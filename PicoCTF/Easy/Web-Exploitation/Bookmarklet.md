# Bookmarklet Walkthrough


### Introduction

This challenge is straightforward, doesn’t require special tools, and offers an interesting way to interact with JavaScript directly. Let’s dive in!

**Challenge Description**

Clicking on the link takes us to a webpage with this message:

### Steps to Solve

> [!NOTE]
> **Understand the Bookmarklet**
> 
> A bookmarklet is a snippet of JavaScript code that can be saved as a browser bookmark. When clicked, the script runs directly in the context of the current webpage.
> 
> In this case, the provided code decrypts an encrypted string (encryptedFlag) using a repeating key (picoctf) and then displays the result in a browser alert.

- **Create the Bookmarklet**
I copied the entire code snippet starting with javascript:(function() { into my clipboard.
Then, I created a new bookmark in my browser and pasted the code into the URL field.

- **Run the Bookmarklet**
After saving the bookmark, I clicked on it while on the challenge webpage.
A pop-up window appeared, revealing the flag.

### Reflection

This challenge was a fun introduction to bookmarklets and showcased how JavaScript can be used in clever ways. It’s also a reminder to always inspect what scripts are doing before running them in your browser—especially when they’re manipulating data or showing alerts.
