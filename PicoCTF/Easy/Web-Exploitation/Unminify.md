# Unminify Walkthrough


The description for this challenge **immediately hinted** at the problem:

_“I don’t like scrolling down to read the code of my website, so I’ve squished it. As a bonus, my pages load faster!”_

The HTML of the site might be **minified**—compressed into one long line of code.

The page itself was tiny and straightforward. It said:

_“If you’re reading this, your browser has successfully received the flag._
_I just deliver flags, I don’t know how to read them…”_

  
This immediately made me suspect that the flag **might be hidden somewhere in the HTML**. The quickest way to check was to inspect the page source.

  

### Inspecting the Source

  
I opened the **Inspector Tool** (F12) and searched for the keyword "picoCTF" using the search bar (Ctrl+F/Cmd+F).

And there it was! The flag was hardcoded right into the HTML. This was the simplest solution and didn’t require any additional tools.


### Solving with cURL


But what if I didn’t want to rely on the browser tools? Another way to solve this challenge was by using **cURL**, a command-line tool to fetch the HTML source directly.

In the terminal, I ran:
```bash
curl http://titan.picoctf.net:63990/
```


This returned the entire HTML of the page in its minified form—all squished together in one long, messy line.

With a bit of focus, we can, also here, read the flag, but let's keep on this game a little it longer.

I had now, a couple of options:

1. **Use an online HTML formatter**:

I could copy the HTML output and paste it into a tool like [FreeFormatter](https://www.freeformatter.com/html-formatter.html). This would make the code more **readable** and help **spot the flag easily.**

2. **Use** grep **to find the flag directly**:

Instead of formatting the code, I could let grep search through the minified HTML and highlight the flag for me. Here’s how:

 - Create a file with nano:
```bash
 sudo nano flag.txt
```

- Copy the minified output of cURL in the file:
![[Unminify - nanocopy.png]]

- Then type ctrl+x, y and enter to save and exit from nano
- Now type this command:
![[Unminify -grep out.png]]

This command pipes the output of curl into grep, which looks for any line containing the keyword "picoCTF".

  

### Alternate Workflow


If I combined both methods, I could first use **cURL** to fetch the HTML, then format the code for readability, and finally use **grep** as a sanity check to find the flag. But honestly, the Inspector Tool was the fastest solution for this challenge.


### Reflections


This challenge was a great reminder that sometimes simplicity is key. While tools like **grep** and **cURL** are powerful, the browser’s built-in tools often provide the fastest solution for quick challenges like this. That said, practicing with terminal tools is always a good habit—especially for more complex scenarios where the browser might not be enough.

> [!NOTE]
> Whether you stick to the browser or flex your terminal skills, the goal is the same: get to the flag in the most efficient way possible. Challenges like these are a great way to get comfortable with multiple approaches, so you’re prepared for anything.

Onward to the next challenge! 🎉
