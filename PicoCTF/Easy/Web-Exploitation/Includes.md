# Includes Walkthrough


This challenge provides very little context. The description simply says:

“Can you get the flag?”

Even the title, _Includes_, offers only a subtle hint. However, it suggests the possibility of vulnerabilities related to external file inclusion, such as accessing scripts or stylesheets.

### Exploring the Site

Visiting the site, I found a single button labeled **“Say Hello”**. Clicking it triggered a pop-up with the message:

“This code is in a separate file!”

This clue implied that the functionality for the pop-up message might be defined in an external JavaScript file.

### Digging Into the Code

To investigate further, I opened the browser developer tools and examined the source code of the page.

Within the **Scripts** section, I located a file that contained the JavaScript function responsible for the alert() pop-up. Interestingly, embedded in the code was what appeared to be **part of the flag**

Continuing to inspect other files loaded by the site, I found a **Style.css** file. Examining its contents revealed the **first part of the flag**.

### Conclusion

By combining the fragments found in the JavaScript and CSS files, I was able to reconstruct the full flag successfully.

This challenge highlights the importance of securing external resources like JavaScript and CSS files. Sensitive data should never be embedded in files accessible to end users. Proper access control and file auditing are crucial to avoid exposing critical information.
