# LocalAuthority Walkthrough


### Introduction

This challenge doesn’t give much information upfront. The description reads:

With such minimal guidance, the first step is to visit the site and investigate what’s going on.


### Exploring the Site

On visiting the site, it appears to be a simple login form. 
Naturally, the first thing to try is a test input. 
I used some dummy credentials (test:123456) to see if anything would happen.

Unsurprisingly, the login was invalid.

### Digging Deeper

Since the surface-level attempt didn’t work, I moved on to inspect the page’s source code using the browser developer tools.

Navigating through the JavaScript section, I came across a function named checkPassword. Inside this function, the correct login password was written in plain text!

### Solving the Challenge

With the password from the JavaScript file, I went back to the login form and entered the discovered credentials.

This time, it worked! The flag was displayed immediately upon successful login.

### Reflection


This challenge highlights a common vulnerability in web applications: storing sensitive data, such as passwords, directly in the client-side code. It serves as a reminder that JavaScript files are fully accessible to anyone using developer tools and should never contain hardcoded credentials or other sensitive information.
