# WebDecode Walkthrough


When I started this challenge, the prompt immediately gave me a clue:

The mention of **inspecting the site** made me think the flag was hidden in the code. So, I clicked on the link to see what was there.


### Exploring the Website

The site itself was simple, almost bare:

There were two other pages: **“About”** and **“Contacts”**. I figured I’d explore them before trying anything more technical.

Both pages were straightforward—just a few motivational phrases from the developer. Nothing jumped out as a flag or a lead. But, on the **“About”** page, the message:

_“Try inspecting this page!!”_

felt like an invitation to dig deeper.


### Inspecting the Page

Opening the **Inspector Tool** (using F12), I took a closer look at the HTML. My first thought was to search for obvious keywords like **“flag” or “picoCTF”** so I used the search bar (Ctrl+F/Cmd+F).

No luck.

Scrolling manually through the HTML, I spotted something that looked unusual:

 It was a long string of text that resembled **Base64 encoding**.

> [!NOTE]
>   **What is Base64?**
>   
> Base64 is a binary-to-text encoding scheme used to represent binary data in an ASCII string format. It’s often used to encode data for safe transmission.
> 
> The string found in the HTML likely contains the flag but is encoded. 


### Decoding the String

I copied the string and used [base64decode.org](https://www.base64decode.org/) to see if it contained anything useful. Sure enough, after pasting the string and hitting “Decode,” the flag appeared!

### Reflections

This challenge wasn’t about complex tools or techniques—it was about paying attention to clues and knowing how to use basic browser features. Recognizing Base64 was the key here, and decoding it online made solving the challenge simple.


If I had wanted to decode it programmatically, here’s a Python script that could do the same thing:

```python
import base64

# Replace this string with the one you found
encoded_str = "your_base64_string_here"

# Decoding the string
decoded_str = base64.b64decode(encoded_str).decode("utf-8")

print(decoded_str)
```

Using a script like this is not only faster but also a great way to practice Python skills for future CTF challenges.

> [!NOTE]
> This challenge was a reminder that sometimes, the solution is simple if you just take the time to look carefully. No fancy tools or complex exploits—just curiosity and a bit of knowledge about encoding. On to the next flag! 🎉
