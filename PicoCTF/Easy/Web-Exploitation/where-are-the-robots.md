The title of this challenge strongly suggests exploring the /robots.txt file, which is commonly used on websites to instruct search engine crawlers about which parts of a site should not be indexed. However, these directives are not secure and can be viewed by anyone.


### Solution

1. **Access the Website:**
	Visit the provided link in the challenge description.

<img width="666" alt="where are the robots site" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c9d0bbf7-d4c8-4f12-81bc-f4d937e4a4f1" />


3. **Inspect the** /robots.txt **File:**
	Since the title hints at “robots,” navigate to /robots.txt by appending it to the base URL of the site.

Example:
http:_//example.com/robots.txt_

3. **Discover the Hidden Path:**
	Inside the /robots.txt file, you find the following:

<img width="629" alt="where are the robots robots" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b1880ab8-a2e9-43ea-a203-a623b7c9c113" />


This line indicates that the page /477ce.html is disallowed for web crawlers but accessible to users.


4. **Navigate to the Hidden Page:**
	Go to /477ce.html by appending it to the site URL.

Example:
http:_//example.com/477ce.html_


5. **Find the Flag:**
	On the hidden page, the flag is revealed.

This challenge demonstrates the risks of using /robots.txt to hide sensitive information. While it serves as a guideline for search engines, it does not restrict users (or attackers) from accessing disallowed pages. Always avoid including sensitive or private data in directories referenced in /robots.txt.
