### Getting Started


The challenge‚Äôs description doesn‚Äôt give much away, but the **title** and the **first hint** make it clear: we‚Äôll need to use **Burp Suite** to solve this.

> [!NOTE]
> What Is Burp Suite?
> 
> Burp Suite is a powerful tool for web application security testing. It acts as a proxy, sitting between your browser and the internet, and allows you to intercept, inspect, and modify HTTP requests and responses. For challenges like this, Burp is perfect for identifying vulnerabilities or testing bypass techniques.

### Setting Up FoxyProxy


To work seamlessly with Burp Suite, I installed the **FoxyProxy** browser extension. It simplifies switching between proxy settings without constantly reconfiguring the browser.

Here‚Äôs how I set it up:

1. Install FoxyProxy from your browser‚Äôs extension store.

2. Go to **Options** in FoxyProxy and create a new proxy.
3. Set the proxy details to:
	- Hostname: 127.0.0.1
	- Port: 8080

Once configured, enable the proxy in FoxyProxy and launch Burp Suite.


### Configuring Burp Suite


Inside Burp Suite:

1. Go to **Target > Scope** and add the URL of the challenge. This ensures that only traffic related to the challenge is logged in **HTTP history**.
2. This setup saves time, as you won‚Äôt need to manually intercept and forward irrelevant requests.

### Exploring the Site

With the proxy active, I visited the challenge URL. The site was basic, featuring just a registration form.

I registered a dummy account

and was presented with a **MFA prompt** asking for a one-time password (OTP).

### Testing the MFA


To test the system, I entered a random OTP, 111111. Unsurprisingly, the site responded with an **‚ÄúInvalid OTP‚Äù** error.

### Analyzing Burp Suite Logs


At this point, I switched to Burp Suite to analyze the recorded requests. By navigating to **Proxy > HTTP History**, I could see all the requests made during my interaction with the site.

Looking through the requests, I found the one responsible for sending the OTP:

## Exploiting the Vulnerability


The second hint mentioned that the server might not handle malformed requests well. This inspired me to try **manipulating the OTP request**.

I modified the request by completely **removing the** otp **parameter**, leaving the body empty:

I sent the modified request, and to my surprise, the response contained the **flag**!

_(Insert manipulated request and flag screenshots here)_

  
### Reflections


This challenge highlighted the importance of thinking critically about how server-side validation works. By omitting the OTP parameter, I bypassed the MFA system entirely‚Äîlikely because the server didn‚Äôt handle unexpected input properly.

While tools like Burp Suite might seem intimidating at first, challenges like this are a great way to build confidence and learn practical techniques for web security testing.

> [!NOTE]
> Simple configurations, attention to detail, and a willingness to experiment made this challenge a fun and rewarding experience. Remember: sometimes the smallest manipulations can lead to the biggest breakthroughs. On to the next flag! üéâ
