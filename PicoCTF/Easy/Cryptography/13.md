This is another super easy challenge. While it’s not particularly interesting from a hacking perspective, it’s a great way to learn about ROT13.

The challenge essentially gives away the solution in its description:
*“Do you know what ROT13 is?”

The encrypted string provided is:
```
cvpbPGS{abg_gbb_onq_bs_n_ceboyrz}
```


A quick search for an online ROT13 decoder allows us to paste the string and decode it.

> [!NOTE]
> **What is ROT13?**
> 
> ROT13, short for “rotate by 13 places,” is a simple substitution cipher. Each letter is replaced with the one 13 positions away in the alphabet.
> 
> 
> For example:
> - **A → N**, **B → O**, … **M → Z**
> - Similarly, **N → A**, **O → B**, … **Z → M**
> 
> Since the Latin alphabet has 26 letters, applying ROT13 twice restores the original text.


ROT13 can be decoded manually, with an online tool, or programmatically. Here’s how to decode it in Python:

```python
import codecs

# ROT13 encoded string
encoded = "cvpbPGS{abg_gbb_onq_bs_n_ceboyrz}"

# Decode using codecs
decoded = codecs.decode(encoded, 'rot_13')

# Print the result
print("Decoded flag:", decoded)
```


#### Conclusion

ROT13 is not secure by modern cryptographic standards but remains a quick and fun cipher to decode, especially for beginners.
